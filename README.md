# Guitar-Modeling
#hopefully a helpful tool to simulate guitars based on whatever choices can be predicted
#takes strings, tunings, an geometry info to predict if what you build ends up being how you'd prefer
#also hopefully can improve accuracy to reality by feeding it more geometry info
#will also could look at deformation of a real object to reccomend modifications to geometry or material choice with user preferences as the standard (action at certain frets, limits on neck size, etc...)
